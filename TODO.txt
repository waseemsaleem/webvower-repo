[WORK-AROUND] the text should be also complied with the prefixes loaded into the ontology

*****
[DONE] Fixed leftsidebar hidding behavior
    (Switching between edit and show mode saves the users preference for showing or hiding the left sidebar)
[DONE] Fixed prefix input Width
[DONE] do not allow to remove rdfs, owl, xsd prefixes
       Fixed hover elements title
       Added Title to IRI of prefix

[Questions]
  [] do we allow to have spaces in iri or
    should this directly  replaced by _

  [] All and exist possible as loops?
  [] Datatypeproperties Characteristics? << only functional?





[DONE] Fix Export As SVG
   -> Editing Elements are somehow now opac; >> lazyRefresh() >> just redraw things

[TODO] Export as JSON
     -> oldVersion was just reading the input file and added some annotations to it;
     -> now we need also to add the edited information;
     -> Most important would be here the meta information (the rest should work out of the box)

-------------------------------------------High PRIORITY-----------------------------------------------------------------
    [] Prevent same definition of a Resources (e.g same named classes)
    [] How are properties handled with different multiple domain and ranges?
[TODO]
    On mobile devices, handling the height, should not change the graph height
    but translate the graph a bit (this should help to keep the nodes from runnig away when keyboard is poped up)


-------------------------------------------MID PRIORITY-----------------------------------------------------------------
    [] Prevent Multiple creation of subclasses between A -> B
    [] Allow shortCut A sco B and B sco A >> A isEquivalent B (create equi class and merge)
    [] Add Equivalent Class and Property to default types
    [DONE] Add backup label variable, when switching between types (e.g class-> thing -> class)
    [] Change position of the property hoverElement when it is hovered but label changed in sidebar.



-------------------------------------------TESTS -----------------------------------------------------------------
    [] Touch devices
    [] test on Iphone
    [] Test on IE -> EDGE
